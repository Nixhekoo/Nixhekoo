<p>Hey, My name is Nixhekoo and i am a 18 Year Old Developer from Slovakia. I love making Systems and Games. I've just started learning C++ recently, and already made few [Programs](https://github.com/Nixhekoo#c). I have Year of experience in Batch but i've mostly been developing text game called "Gem Miner". If you are interested, you can download them here:</p>
